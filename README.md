# JoplinWelcome
Just somewhere to keep and share the stuff I threw together as welcome guide idea

Based on the discussion in this thread - https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/joplin-welcome-landing-page-split-from-silent-updates/21973

Currently just some hand...crafted(??) HTML and CSS with a couple of assets ~~stolen~~borrowed from the Joplin assets and designs ~~liberally nicked~~inspired by apps with similar functionality.

Try not to laugh too hard at the HTML and CSS, I'm renowned for being dangerous with a keyboard, a text editor, too little knowledge and too much gin. I once created a SQL query that caused an oracle DBA to question his life choices and my employer relies on a VBA macro I created that I no longer comprehend.

Requires the free version of font awesome 5 to be plonked in the root directory to get the FA fonts (used for the icons) - https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/how-to-use/on-the-web/setup/hosting-font-awesome-yourself
