# Joplin Stuff

Literally a place to keep my stuff that is Joplin related.
Each folder is simply a project in its own right.

## Joplin Welcome
A mockup design of what a welcome splash screen could look like in Joplin. More info in `/JoplinWelcome/README.md`

## Joplin StyleGuide
An idea, mostly for my own purposes, to create a unified Joplin-wide style guide for easy reference of colours + styles as used on the various applications as well as the website.
Hopefully can be used to start discussions, if nothing else, into creation of a proper design language and design system, unifying the Joplin brand as a whole and allowing for easer theming support in the long run.
