# JoplinWelcome
Just somewhere to keep and share the stuff I threw together as welcome guide idea

Based on the discussion in this thread - https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/joplin-welcome-landing-page-split-from-silent-updates/21973

Currently just some hand...crafted?? HTML and CSS with a couple of assets ~~stolen~~borrowed from the Joplin assets and designs ~~liberally nicked~~inspired by apps with similar functionality
